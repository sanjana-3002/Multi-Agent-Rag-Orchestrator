DAY 9: CRO AGENT & MULTI-AGENT ROUTING
CampaignBrain Project - Week 2 Continues
================================================================================

Date: February 15, 2026
Time Spent: 4-5 hours
Cost: ~$1-2 (CRO agent testing + routing)
Status: ✅ COMPLETE

================================================================================
WHAT WE BUILT TODAY
================================================================================

Today we crossed a major milestone: moving from single agent to MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM.

Three Core Components:
1. CRO Agent (cro_agent.py) - Marketing & revenue specialist
2. Agent Router (agent_router.py) - Intelligent query routing
3. Test Suite (test_agents.py) - Comprehensive testing

THE BIG ACHIEVEMENT:
We now have multiple specialized agents that automatically handle different 
types of queries. The system intelligently routes "What was revenue?" to CFO 
and "How did our campaign perform?" to CRO.

This is how real AI systems work in production!

================================================================================
THE MULTI-AGENT PARADIGM SHIFT
================================================================================

SINGLE AGENT (Day 8):
- One generalist agent tries to do everything
- Works, but not optimal
- Like having one employee handle finance AND marketing AND sales

User: "What was our revenue and how did campaigns perform?"
→ One agent tries to answer both parts
→ Jack of all trades, master of none

MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM (Day 9):
- Multiple specialist agents, each expert in their domain
- Router directs queries to right specialist
- Like having a CFO, CRO, and coordinator

User: "What was our revenue and how did campaigns perform?"
→ Router splits into two questions
→ CFO handles revenue question
→ CRO handles campaign question  
→ Coordinator combines answers
→ Specialists = better quality

WHY MULTI-AGENT IS BETTER:

1. SPECIALIZATION
   - Each agent is expert in its domain
   - Better tool selection
   - More accurate analysis
   - Domain-specific language

2. SCALABILITY
   - Easy to add new agents (HR, Legal, Product, etc.)
   - Each agent can be developed independently
   - No single agent becomes too complex

3. MAINTAINABILITY
   - Bug in CFO agent doesn't affect CRO agent
