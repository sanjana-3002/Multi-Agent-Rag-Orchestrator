This profit can be considered as available funds for investments, including marketing spend. \n\nAnalyzing the campaign performance data for Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads in Q4 2024, we see that doubling marketing spend could impact the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and potentially lead to proportional revenue growth. However, it's crucial to optimize high-performing channels, test incremental increases, conduct A/B testing, monitor performance continuously, and invest in retargeting to maximize the effectiveness of increased marketing spend.\n\nTherefore, based on the available funds and the performance analysis, it seems feasible to consider doubling marketing spend, but it's important to implement the recommended strategies to ensure a positive impact on revenue growth while maintaining cost-efficiency.",
